Project: Predicting Heart Disease with Classification Machine Learning Algorithms

Goal:
Predict whether a patient should be diagnosed with Heart Disease. This is a binary outcome.
  Positive (+) = 1, patient diagnosed with Heart Disease
  Negative (-) = 0, patient not diagnosed with Heart Disease
Experiment with various Classification Models & see which yields greatest accuracy.
Examine trends & correlations within our data
Determine which features are most important to Positive/Negative Heart Disease diagnosis
